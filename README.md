# JMinesField
A Simple matrix generator for MinesweeperÂ® Games written in Java.

I wrapped the class in a maven project to test it with a web view.
On the backend there are some Spring Controllers, added on the fly.
On the frontend I added some rude Jquery ajax handling; to be improved as well.

The project is still embryonic, whoever wanna help, is welcome.

TBD f.e.: 
* graphics
* responsiveness
* select size and difficulty
* show all bombs on death
