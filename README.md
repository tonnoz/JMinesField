# JMinesField
A Simple matrix generator for MinesweeperÂ® Games written in Java.

##### New:
I wrapped the class in a maven project to test it with a web view.
On the backend there are some Spring Controllers, added on the fly.
On the frontend I added some rude Jquery ajax handling; to be improved as well.
The field is made out of input buttons, forgive my lazyness :D
The project is still embryonic, whoever wanna help, is welcome.


## Features/TODO:
Core:
- [x] Simple Java field generation
- [x] Simple endpoints to interact with the core
- [ ] errors handling / log
- [ ] better field creation

Web:
- [x] show all bombs on death
- [ ] select size and difficulty 
- [ ] responsiveness
- [ ] improve web view
- [ ] HTML5 / SASS
- [ ] Canvas?


## Install Requirements:

* JDK 7
