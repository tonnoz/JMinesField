# JMinesField
A Simple matrix generator for MinesweeperÂ® Games written in Java.

##### New:
I wrapped the class in a maven project to test it with a web view.
On the backend there are some Spring Controllers, added on the fly.
On the frontend I added some rude Jquery ajax handling; to be improved as well.
The project is still embryonic, whoever wanna help, is welcome.


## Features:

- [x] Frontend game
- [x] Java backend field generation
- [x] Simple endpoints to interact with the core
- [ ] show all bombs on death
- [ ] select size and difficulty 
- [ ] responsiveness

## Install Requirements:

* Java 7
* Maven (or IDE Maven compatible)


## TODO:

* improve web view
* add error handling
* use session
* introduce phonegap or similar
