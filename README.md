# JMinesField
A Simple matrix generator for MinesweeperÂ® Games written in Java.

I wrap the class in a maven project to test it with a web view.
On the backend there's some Spring Controllers, added on the fly.
On the front I added some rude Ajax handling; to be improved as well.

The project is still embryonic, whoever wanna help, is welcome.
